# 6502 #
Verilog implementation of a MOS6502 compatible CPU core.

## Introduction
This is an attempt at implementing the CPU. Just for fun.

The core is not (will not) be cycle correct. It is a clean RTL
implementation based on the instruction set.


## Status
Core is not done and does not yet work.
